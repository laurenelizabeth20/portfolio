# Overview

The purpose of this project was for me to learn Django and create a user registration and log in for a website I am working on. This program was my first that uses Django, I learned a lot from this that I am excited to implement to further develop this web app. I used Django to allow user's to sign up for an account and log in and out of that account. This web app is on a test server, which I started using the python manage.py runserver command. The website that displays the app on the test server is http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

# Web Pages

I have made a home page, login page, and registration page. The homepage has a link to either log in or log out, depending on whether the user has already logged in or not. If the user clicks on the link to log in, they are sent to the log in page and if they do not have an account, there is a link to the registeration page that once submitted will send the user back to the log in page. Once the user submits the log in, they are sent back to the home page.
