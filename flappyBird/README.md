# Overview

I wrote this program to help introduce me to the Java language and get comfortable with its syntax. This program is a copycat flappy bird game. It generates random columns and the user must click or tap on the screen to move their square to avoid the columns, if they hit one it is game over. I learned a lot about Java, particularly how to draw graphics with Java.
