# Overview

This project was to help me develop my skills with the arcade library and Python. I also learned more about the random library. This is a picture matching game. It starts with a grid of white squares, the user then clicks on one square and a picture will appear. The user then clicks another white square, if the picture that appears does not match the previous one, the user clicks that square again and it turns white and the user tries to find the square that does match. Once they match, the user repeats until all pictures are matched.
